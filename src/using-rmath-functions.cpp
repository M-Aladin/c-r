 * @summary Illustrates how to access statistical distribution functions from
 *   the standalone R math library (Rmath.h)
 *
 * R, as a statistical language and environment, has very well written and
 * tested statistical distribution functions providing probability density,
 * cumulative distribution, quantiles and random number draws for dozens of
 * common and not so common distribution functions. This code is used inside
 * R, and available for use from standalone C or C++ programs via the
 * standalone R math library which Debian / Ubuntu have as a package `r-mathlib`
 * (and which can be built from R sources).
 *
 * The short example below shows this for a simple function taking a vector, 
 * and returning its pnorm computed using the R `pnorm` function:
 */
 
#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::NumericVector mypnorm(Rcpp::NumericVector x) {
    
   int n = x.size();
   Rcpp::NumericVector y(n);

   for (int i=0; i<n; i++) 
      y[i] = R::pnorm(x[i], 0.0, 1.0, 1, 0);

   return y;
}

/**
 * We can now use the function to compute the probability distribution: 
 */
 
/*** R

x <- seq(0, 1, length=1e3)
res <- mypnorm(x)
head(res)

*/

/**
 * Note that the C++ code, through its use via Rcpp attributes, will be augmented with 
 * an automatic instantiation of a `RNGScope` object which ensures a proper state
 * of the R random number generator.
