The Source command both executes the sourceCpp function and monitors the results of the compilation for errors. If errors do occur then the gcc error log is parsed into a navigable list:

```{r}
library(Rcpp)

sourceCpp("../src/convolve.cpp")

x <- matrix(rnorm(10))
y <- matrix(rnorm(10))

convolveCpp(x, y)
```

Note that you can also check the Source on Save option to automatically source the C++ file every time it is saved. This variation will keep the keyboard focus within the editor whereas the Source command will move focus to the console.

```{r}
x = c(3, 4, 5, 0, 0)
y = c(2, 1)

convolve(x, y)
```
